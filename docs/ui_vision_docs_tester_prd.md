# DocuVision: AI-Powered Documentation Testing
## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Executive Summary

DocuVision is an automated testing system that validates documentation accuracy by having AI read step-by-step instructions and use computer vision to verify that applications behave exactly as documented. This addresses the critical gap where documentation becomes outdated or inaccurate, leading to poor user experience and support burden.

### Problem Statement

**Primary Pain Points:**
- Documentation frequently becomes outdated after UI changes
- Manual verification of docs against actual app behavior is time-intensive and error-prone
- Users encounter frustration when following incorrect documentation
- Teams lack automated validation that documentation matches reality
- No systematic way to catch documentation drift during development cycles

**Business Impact:**
- Increased customer support tickets from confused users
- Reduced user satisfaction and onboarding success rates
- Developer time wasted maintaining inaccurate documentation
- Lost user adoption due to poor first-time experience

### Solution Overview

DocuVision combines three core technologies:
1. **Claude AI** to parse and understand documentation
2. **Ui.Vision RPA** for computer vision and browser automation
3. **Intelligent verification** that compares expected vs. actual user experience

The system reads documentation, executes the described steps using computer vision, and reports discrepancies between what the docs say should happen and what actually occurs.

### Key Features

#### Core Functionality
- **Document Parser**: AI-powered extraction of step-by-step instructions from various documentation formats
- **Visual Step Executor**: Computer vision automation that follows parsed instructions
- **Reality Verification**: Intelligent comparison between expected and actual UI states
- **Discrepancy Reporting**: Detailed reports highlighting where documentation doesn't match reality

#### User Experience Features
- **Multi-format Support**: Works with markdown, HTML, PDFs, and plain text documentation
- **Visual Diff Reports**: Screenshot-based reports showing expected vs. actual states
- **Integration Ready**: API and CLI interfaces for CI/CD pipeline integration
- **Batch Processing**: Test multiple documentation sections simultaneously

#### Advanced Features
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Handles dynamic content and loading states
- **Context Awareness**: Understands prerequisites and setup requirements
- **Accessibility Validation**: Ensures documented workflows work for screen readers
- **Mobile Responsive Testing**: Validates documentation across different screen sizes

### Target Users

#### Primary Users
- **QA Engineers**: Automate documentation testing as part of quality assurance
- **Technical Writers**: Validate documentation accuracy before publication
- **Product Teams**: Ensure user-facing workflows remain accurate after changes

#### Secondary Users
- **Support Teams**: Proactively identify documentation issues before users encounter them
- **DevOps Engineers**: Integrate documentation validation into CI/CD pipelines
- **UX Researchers**: Validate that actual user flows match intended designs

### Success Metrics

#### Key Performance Indicators
- **Documentation Accuracy**: % of documentation that passes validation
- **Issue Detection Rate**: Number of documentation errors caught per testing cycle
- **Time to Resolution**: Reduction in time from documentation error to fix
- **User Experience Impact**: Decrease in support tickets related to confusing documentation

#### Business Metrics
- **Cost Savings**: Reduction in support overhead and manual documentation testing
- **User Satisfaction**: Improved onboarding and task completion rates
- **Development Velocity**: Faster documentation updates and validation cycles

### Technical Architecture

#### System Components
1. **Document Ingestion Service**
   - Accepts various documentation formats
   - Extracts structured step-by-step instructions
   - Identifies UI elements and expected outcomes

2. **AI Parsing Engine**
   - Claude integration for natural language understanding
   - Converts prose instructions into executable test steps
   - Identifies prerequisites and context requirements

3. **Computer Vision Testing Engine**
   - Ui.Vision RPA integration for browser automation
   - Visual element recognition and interaction
   - Screenshot capture and comparison

4. **Validation and Reporting Service**
   - Compares expected vs. actual outcomes
   - Generates visual diff reports
   - Provides actionable feedback for documentation fixes

#### Data Flow
```
Documentation Input → AI Parser → Test Steps → CV Execution → Reality Check → Report Generation
```

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Process documentation pages in under 30 seconds
- Support concurrent testing of up to 10 documentation sections
- Generate reports within 60 seconds of test completion

#### Reliability
- 99% accuracy in step extraction for well-structured documentation
- Graceful handling of dynamic content and loading states
- Robust error recovery and retry mechanisms

#### Scalability
- Handle documentation sets of up to 1000 pages
- Support integration with multiple applications simultaneously
- Horizontal scaling for increased testing throughput

#### Security
- Local processing with no external data transmission (leveraging Ui.Vision's local architecture)
- Optional cloud deployment with enterprise security controls
- Audit logging for compliance requirements

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks
- **AI Parsing Accuracy**: Claude may misinterpret complex or poorly written instructions
  - *Mitigation*: Human review workflow for ambiguous sections
- **UI Element Recognition**: Computer vision may fail on dynamic or unusual UI elements
  - *Mitigation*: Fallback to text-based element identification
- **Application Changes**: Frequent UI updates may cause test instability
  - *Mitigation*: Self-healing mechanisms and baseline update workflows

#### Business Risks
- **Adoption Barriers**: Teams may resist adding another tool to their workflow
  - *Mitigation*: Seamless integration and clear ROI demonstration
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Tool itself may require significant upkeep
  - *Mitigation*: Automated updates and minimal configuration design

### Dependencies

#### External Dependencies
- Claude AI API access for document parsing
- Ui.Vision RPA browser extension
- Target applications must be web-based or have web interfaces
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

#### Internal Dependencies
- Development team familiar with AI integration and computer vision
- QA/Technical writing team for validation and feedback
- Infrastructure for hosting and CI/CD integration

### Competitive Analysis

#### Current Alternatives
- **Manual Testing**: Time-intensive, inconsistent, doesn't scale
- **Applitools/Percy**: Focus on visual regression, not documentation validation
- **Traditional UI Testing**: Tests functionality, not documentation accuracy

#### Competitive Advantages
- **Unique Problem Focus**: Only solution specifically targeting documentation accuracy
- **AI-Powered Intelligence**: Understands context and intent, not just visual changes
- **End-to-End Validation**: Tests complete user workflows as documented
- **Cost-Effective**: Leverages open-source components with AI enhancement

### Roadmap

#### Phase 1: MVP (3 months)
- Basic document parsing for markdown and HTML
- Integration with Ui.Vision RPA for simple workflows
- Screenshot-based validation and reporting
- CLI interface for manual testing

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence (6 months)
