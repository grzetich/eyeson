## Why This Beats Documentation Testing

### Larger Market Opportunity
- **4M+ designers** vs. hundreds of thousands of technical writers
- **$3.4B UX tools market** vs. niche documentation testing
- **Legal compliance pressure** driving enterprise adoption
- **Broader use cases** across entire product development lifecycle

### Stronger Network Effects
- **Viral sharing potential**: Design critiques are highly shareable
- **Community engagement**: Designers love discussing and sharing work
- **Educational value**: Content marketing opportunities are massive
- **Tool integration**: Natural fit with existing design workflows

### Better Unit Economics
- **Higher willingness to pay**: Design teams have larger budgets
- **Multiple buyer personas**: Designers, PMs, developers, accessibility teams
- **Enterprise potential**: Compliance and legal risk create urgency
- **Expansion revenue**: Teams grow usage over time

### Competitive Moats
- **AI expertise barrier**: Combining computer vision + UX knowledge is rare
- **Data advantage**: More usage = better AI recommendations
- **Community moat**: First-mover advantage in AI design critique
- **Platform effects**: Integrations with design tools create stickiness

This pivoted direction leverages the same core AI+CV technology but targets a much larger, higher-value market with stronger viral potential and network effects.
