# Roadmap

## Provide code
Provide the code (JS, HTML, or CSS) needed to make the recommended changes. Will upcharge customers for this service.

## Deeper review
Find out how to review other pages than the landing page, ie ones that require login or are linked (the app will need to follow links). Could be a functionality branch from design/UX review to information architecture review.
