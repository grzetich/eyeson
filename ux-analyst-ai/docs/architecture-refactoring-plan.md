# Robust Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to refactor the UX Analyst AI system to eliminate recurring issues with hanging processes, timeouts, and system instability. The refactoring addresses root causes through improved architecture, error handling, and resource management.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Hanging/Timeout Issues
- **Root Cause**: Infinite API calls without proper timeout handling
- **Impact**: Gemini API calls hang indefinitely causing stuck analyses
- **Secondary Issues**: Browser process leaks, memory stack overflows

### 2. Architecture Problems
- **Tight Coupling**: Services directly depend on each other (circular dependencies)
- **No Error Boundaries**: Failures in one component crash entire analysis
- **Poor Resource Management**: No proper cleanup of external resources
- **Monolithic Processing**: All analysis steps run in single pipeline

### 3. Scalability Issues
- **In-Memory Processing**: Large images processed entirely in memory
- **No Queue System**: Concurrent analyses limited by hardcoded values
- **No Graceful Degradation**: Single component failure stops entire system

### 4. Configuration Problems
- **Missing Environment Validation**: No validation of required environment variables
- **Hardcoded Timeouts**: Timeout values scattered throughout codebase
- **No Health Checks**: No way to verify system health before processing
